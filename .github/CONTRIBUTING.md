# ⚙ Getting Started

### Set up a Github token to make it easy to install the private algodex-sdk npm package.

https://github.com/settings/tokens

Make sure you add the "read:packages" permission.
Copy and save the secret.

In a Linux terminal (git-bash on Windows):

create an ~/.npmrc file with the following contents:
```
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=tokensecretgoeshere
@algodex:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
```
or you can use npm login with your token
```
$ npm login --scope=@algodex --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
> Username: USERNAME
> Password: TOKEN_SECRET
> Email: PUBLIC-EMAIL-ADDRESS
```

### Clone and install the necessary libraries

```
yarn
```

### Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Further edits info (default docs):

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
